# Vegetable Disease Image Classification CNN Project
Hi! 

In this deep-learning project, I use the tensorflow, numpy, notebook, & matplotlib libraries in python to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify nearly a dozen different diseases including blight, bacterial mold, spider mites, mosaic & curl viruses from tomato & potato plants. Additionally, I supported my created models with a complete backend FastAPI server. 

Feel free to check it out!
